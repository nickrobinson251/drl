# MSc project code

This repo contains work done during my MSc project with Edinburgh Robotics in collaboration with Chuanyu Yang and Zhibin Li.

The code contains the Pybullet physics simulation of the valkyrie robot, written as a OpenAI Gym training environment, 
and scripts for running agents to learn in the environment, some of which rely on [a fork of the Soft Q-learning package](https://github.com/nickrobinson251/softqlearning)
